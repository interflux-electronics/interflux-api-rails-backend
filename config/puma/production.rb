# By defining the amount of workers we enable "clustered mode". In clustered
# mode one mother process will spawn X amount of child processes (workers)
# effectively allowing us to leverage each CPU cores for higher concurrency.
# The recommended number of workers is the same amount of CPU cores your server
# has (never more). With 2 workers, you should see 3 puma pids when running:
# `ps aux | grep puma`. One is the mother, 1 mother and 2 are the children.
# Killing the mother also ends the child processes. Killing a child process will
# cause them to respawn with a new pid.
workers 2

# Per worker spin up 0 to 5 threads based on how much traffic is present. With
# 2 workers we would have 0 to 10 threads running + internally created threads.
# Each thread takes up RAM space, thus adjust these to optimise RAM usage.

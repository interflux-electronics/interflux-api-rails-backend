# SETUP LOCAL (MAC)

brew update
brew install rbenv ruby-build



# As long brew exists in the PATH, then rbenv will exist as well and all next
# steps are not necessary?

# eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"
# echo "$PATH"

# Someone suggest to then add `rbenv` to path, but no need...

# set --universal fish_user_paths $fish_user_paths ~/.rbenv/shims

# Instead:

# rbenv init

# Suggest to add the following to Fish config:

# atom ~/.config/fish/config.fish
# status --is-interactive; and source (rbenv init -|psub)

#  Install and start Postgres

brew install postgresql
brew services start postgresql@14

# Clone repo

git clone git@github.com:janwerkhoven/api.interflux.com.git
cd api.interflux.com

# Install Ruby

rbenv install -s
rbenv rehash

# When you run
ruby -v

# Your Mac will likely show
# ruby 2.6.10p210 (2022-04-12 revision 67958) [universal.arm64e-darwin22]
# Which is the version Mac is locked down to and not the one we use in our repository.

# By adding the rbenv directory to the $PATH
set --universal fish_user_paths $fish_user_paths ~/.rbenv/shims
# Then
ruby -v
# Should output
# ruby 3.0.0p0 (2020-12-25 revision 95aff21468) [arm64-darwin21]
# inside our repo and
# ruby 2.6.10p210 (2022-04-12 revision 67958) [universal.arm64e-darwin22]
# outside our repo.
